### Features
The bot has the following features:
- ⚙️ Easy Setup (simply run a script and enter the correct information, no 'coding' needed)
- ⬆️ Auto-levelling (Level up all your duel Pokémon to level 100 **overnight**!)
- ✨ Get notified when and if you've caught a Pokémon, and also if another event occurs
    - See when a Shiny/Legendary/Ultra Beast/Mythical Pokémon is caught, and which one it is!
- 💲 **Completely free** and open-source (you can see the code as it is currently)
- 💕 **Trustworthy**; this autocatcher is **completely** Free!
- 🏎️ Super fast; the autocatcher can even handle Incense!
- 🔍 Pokétwo-Resistant - the autocatcher sends a random series of numbers to enhance undetectability

### Getting Started:
To start up the bot on replit, go to the 'Secrets' tab on replit (the lock icon) and in the 'key' area, write `user_token`, and then type in your discord account token in the 'value' section. <br>

**Secrets you have to put**:

`user_token` ~~-->~~ The token of the user you want to autocatch\
`spam_id` ~~-->~~ The id of the channel in which you want to spam\
`catch_id` ~~-->~~ The id of the channel in which you want the bot to spam (First you need to redirect Pokétwo's spawns to that channel)\
`bot_owner` ~~-->~~ The id of the owner of the bot.\
`logs_id` (Optional) ~~-->~~ The id of the channel in which you want the bot to send all information. Every catch, it sends the type of the pokemon you caught, all pokemon, legendary pokemon, mythical pokemon and shiny pokemon you caught during the time the bot was active. This count sometimes reset if the bot is paused some hours, because captcha or other reasons.\
`captcha_ping` (Optional) ~~-->~~ Only works if `logs_id` secret exists. It is the id of the player you want to ping. You can get it right-clicking the guy you want to ping and getting his id.\

**Other Things you can change:**\
Prefix ~~-->~~ You can change the prefix of the commands of the bot by changing the value of the variable `bot_prefix` on the line 6. Default one is `%`.

**Commands:**\
`%start` and `%stop` commands are used to control the bot without accesing replit or uptime robot. We only recommend using them if you have your bot on uptime robot, else, they will be useless because you need to have replit opened, and if you have it opened, you can stop or start it easily. You can't use them if there's a pending captcha. Use the command below instead.
`%captcha_ping` is used to confirm the pending captcha was done. Obviously, you can only use this if there's a pending captcha.
`%say` is used to make the bot say things. This is useful if you don't want to log in into the alt if you want to check, for example, your money. You can use "%say @Pokétwo bal". 

**Important Details**\
`%start`, `%stop`, `%captcha_ping` and `%say` commands can be used by anyone in any server your alt's in. It's recommended to leave all servers before use autocatcher.

After you've done that, please see the below section.

#### <b>Running</b>
Once you have installed the correct dependencies, click the green 'Run' icon at the top of your webpage. If a new window opens up with 'Bot logged on' written inside, and `Logged into account: <account name>` has appeared into your console, then the bot has successfully started.

> Remember to cd into your autocatcher folder as well. If you need any help with something, feel free to dm me on discord

## **DISCLAIMER**

Please note that self botting is against Discord's Terms of Service and being discovered using a self bot may result in your account being banned. To avoid this, keep knowledge of your self bot to a minimum and use a throwaway account. I am not responsible for any accounts lost due to the self bot. I also recommend checking the self bot channel's messages occasionally to see if Pokétwo has sent a captcha. **If it has, it would be a good idea to solve it.**
